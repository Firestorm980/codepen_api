Codepen API
===========

This API is largely based off of the [CodePen v2 API](https://github.com/natewiley/cpv2api). I found that the CodePen v2 API had certain drawbacks that made it unsuitable for my own personal needs. Plus, this was a good opportunity to learn how to make my own API using node using someone else's (great) work as a base. So big thanks to [natewiley](https://github.com/natewiley) for making the original API. 

I'm not sure how much I'll keep this particular project going. At the very least, it was a good base for node.
